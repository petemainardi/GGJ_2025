# UnityTemplate
My personal Unity project template, configured with the essentials that *every* Unity project I work on should have out of the box.

**NOTE:**<br/>
You must reinitialize TMP Essentials and DOTween, as only their settings files are committed to source control.<br/>
The default asmdef should automatically pick up their references after doing so.

## Configured with the following packages:
- Universal Render Pipeline
- 2D Sprite
- Input System
- TextMeshPro
- [Nuget for Unity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)
- [MainArtery.Utilities](https://github.com/petemainardi/MainArtery)
- [MainArtery.Utilities.Unity](https://github.com/petemainardi/MainArtery-Utilities)
- [DOTweenPro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/dotween-pro-32416)
- [EditorAttributes](https://github.com/v0lt13/EditorAttributes)
- [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask)
- [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx)
